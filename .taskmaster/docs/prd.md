# Quick Emoji Plugin - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Quick Emoji is a mature Obsidian plugin that enables quick emoji insertion via typing `:`. This PRD focuses on implementing a new shortcode-first rendering system where emojis are stored as `:shortcode:` in Markdown but rendered as native emoji glyphs in Live Preview and Reading modes.

---

## Current State (v1.0.4)

### Existing Features ‚úÖ

- **Emoji Picker Trigger**: Type ":" to activate emoji suggester in any editor
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time emoji search using emoji-mart SearchIndex with debouncing
- **Recent Emoji History**: Persistent storage of recently used emojis with configurable count (5-50)
- **Favorites System**: Star emojis for quick access, persistent across sessions
- **Skin Tone Support**: Customizable default skin tone for supported emojis
- **Settings Management**: Comprehensive settings tab with emoji preview and management
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on desktop and mobile Obsidian
- **Performance**: Lazy-loaded emoji-mart for fast plugin startup
- **Code Organization**: Source files in `src/` directory, modular structure

### Technical Architecture

- **Core**: TypeScript-based Obsidian plugin using Plugin API
- **Dependencies**: emoji-mart library for data and search functionality
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for recent emoji persistence, Obsidian data API for settings
- **UI**: EditorSuggest API for popup interface and suggestion rendering
- **Build System**: ESBuild for compilation and bundling

## New Enhancement: Shortcode-First Rendering

### Overview

Transform the plugin to always insert emoji as `:shortcode:` into Markdown files, then render these as native emoji glyphs in Live Preview and Reading modes via post-processing. This approach ensures compatibility with other platforms (like Discourse) that use emoji shortcodes.

### Goals

1. **Replace suggester insertion** to always write `:shortcode:` (e.g., `:smile:`) instead of native emoji
2. **Add Markdown post-processor** that converts `:shortcode:` ‚Üí emoji glyph during rendering
3. **Respect boundaries**: Skip code blocks, inline code, and math segments
4. **Apply skin tone** when rendering based on user settings
5. **Maintain existing features**: Keep recents/favorites logic intact
6. **Mode-aware rendering**: Show shortcodes in Source Mode, emojis in Live Preview/Reading

### Non-Goals

- No custom parser overhaul or core Markdown replacement
- No toggle to disable rendering (always on by default)
- No changes to the emoji picker UI itself

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] In Strict Source Mode, suggestions insert `:shortcode:` (partially done - only in source mode currently)
- [ ] In Live Preview/Reading, rendered content shows emoji glyphs for `:shortcode:` (NOT WORKING)
- [ ] Code blocks, inline code, and math are not altered
- [ ] Always insert shortcodes regardless of mode (currently mode-dependent)
- [ ] Lint passes with no errors
- [ ] No runtime errors in console

### Implementation Status

**Completed:**

- ‚úÖ Mode detection utility functions (isSourceMode, isStrictSourceMode)
- ‚úÖ Settings toggle for inserting shortcodes in source mode

**In Progress:**

- üîÑ Post-processor code written but NOT VERIFIED WORKING in Obsidian
- üîÑ Suggester currently inserts shortcodes only in Strict Source Mode
- üîÑ Need to update to ALWAYS insert shortcodes

**Not Started:**

- ‚ùå Debug and fix post-processor (not rendering in Live Preview/Reading)
- ‚ùå Update favorites/recents display to handle shortcode storage
- ‚ùå Fix recents tracking (broken when inserting shortcodes)
- ‚ùå Remove unnecessary source mode setting
- ‚ùå Comprehensive testing across all scenarios
- ‚ùå Documentation updates

### Technical Details

- **Shortcode Format**: `:emoji_id:` using emoji-mart's id field
- **Post-processor**: Uses `registerMarkdownPostProcessor` with text node walking
- **Resolution**: Search by id first, then name as fallback
- **Skin Tone**: Applied via `getEmojiWithSkin` utility during rendering

## Future Roadmap (Post-Shortcode Implementation)

### Phase 1: Plugin Submission Compliance

- Remove "Obsidian" from plugin title/headers (reserved for first-party)
- Update copyright information
- Clean up logging statements
- Settings UI compliance (sentence case, proper heading API)

### Phase 2: Performance & Stability

- Optimize emoji search performance
- Improve memory management
- Enhanced error handling
- Better cleanup on plugin unload

### Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements

- Improved visual design and animations
- Better mobile experience
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Enhanced settings organization

### Phase 4: Feature Expansion

- Custom emoji categories
- Emoji shortcuts and aliases
- Export/import preferences
- Integration with other plugins

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

- Custom emoji support (user uploads)
- Emoji usage analytics
- Advanced search features
- Collaborative emoji sharing

## User Personas & Flows

### Current User Personas

- **Note-takers**: Users who want to add emojis to enhance their notes
- **Content Creators**: Users creating rich, expressive content
- **Mobile Users**: Users needing efficient emoji input on mobile
- **Cross-Platform Users**: NEW - Users who copy/paste between Obsidian and platforms like Discourse

### User Flow (After Implementation)

1. User types ":" in any editor ‚Üí emoji suggester appears
2. User types search terms ‚Üí filtered emoji results shown
3. User navigates with arrow keys ‚Üí preview of selected emoji
4. User presses Enter ‚Üí `:shortcode:` inserted at cursor
5. In Live Preview/Reading ‚Üí `:shortcode:` renders as emoji glyph
6. In Source Mode ‚Üí `:shortcode:` remains visible as text

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

- **Performance Impact**: Post-processor might slow rendering
  - Mitigation: Optimize regex, cache results, limit scope
- **Compatibility**: Existing notes with native emojis
  - Mitigation: Only process shortcodes, leave native emojis untouched
- **Edge Cases**: Complex nested structures
  - Mitigation: Thorough boundary testing

### User Experience Risks

- **Breaking Change**: Users expecting native emoji insertion
  - Mitigation: Clear documentation, consider migration command
- **Learning Curve**: Users unfamiliar with shortcodes
  - Mitigation: Visual feedback in suggester showing shortcode format

---

## Development Priorities

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Complete shortcode-first implementation
   - Update suggester to always insert shortcodes
   - Fix any remaining post-processor issues
   - Comprehensive testing

2. **NEXT**: Plugin submission compliance
   - Address naming and branding issues
   - Clean up code quality issues

3. **FUTURE**: Performance and feature enhancements
   - Based on user feedback
   - Maintain backward compatibility
