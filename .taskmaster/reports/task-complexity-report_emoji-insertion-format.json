		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Update Settings Schema and Default Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is atomic and does not require further expansion.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves a minimal, localized code change to a TypeScript interface and a constant object. The risk is very low, and the work is confined to a single logical unit, making it too small to subdivide effectively."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure Setting Persistence and Migration",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is focused on verification and testing and is best handled as a single unit.",
			"reasoning": "The core of this task is verifying that an existing, standard implementation pattern works as expected. The complexity lies in the manual testing of different user scenarios (new vs. existing user), not in writing new code. It's a cohesive verification effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Add Insertion Format Dropdown to Settings UI",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for implementing the UI component for the 'Insertion Format' setting and connecting its state to the plugin's settings persistence layer.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves two distinct activities: rendering a UI element using the Obsidian API and handling its state changes to persist the data. Separating the UI implementation from the data-binding logic creates clearer, more focused subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Centralized Emoji Insertion Helper",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task down into implementing the core `insertEmoji` helper function and writing a corresponding set of unit tests to verify its behavior for both 'unicode' and 'shortcode' formats.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a new, reusable utility function is a distinct effort from writing robust unit tests for it. Separating these allows for a test-driven approach and ensures the testing phase is not overlooked for this critical, shared logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Insertion Helper into Emoji Suggester",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for refactoring the `selectSuggestion` method to use the new `insertEmoji` helper and for performing comprehensive integration testing to ensure Unicode, shortcode, and skin tone variations work correctly through the suggester UI.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity here is higher due to modifying a core, interactive component. The refactoring itself is one step, but the multi-faceted testing required (format switching, skin tones) is a significant validation effort that warrants its own subtask to ensure quality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Update Recent Emojis to Use Insertion Helper",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is atomic and does not require further expansion.",
			"reasoning": "This task is a small, self-contained refactoring of a single click handler. The main challenge is accessing the editor instance, but the overall change is minimal and doesn't benefit from further decomposition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Update Favorite Emojis to Use Insertion Helper",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is atomic and does not require further expansion.",
			"reasoning": "Functionally identical to task 6, this is a focused refactoring of a single event handler. The scope is too small to be broken down into meaningful subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Update Plugin Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task down into drafting the descriptive text for the new 'Insertion Format' feature in the README.md and a separate task for capturing, optimizing, and embedding a clear screenshot of the new setting in the documentation.",
			"reasoning": "While not technically complex, good documentation involves distinct steps. Separating the copywriting (drafting text) from the asset creation (screenshot) allows for a more organized workflow and better focus on each aspect of the documentation."
