# Task ID: 1
# Title: Update Settings Schema and Default Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the QuickEmojiSettings interface to include the new insertionFormat property and update the DEFAULT_SETTINGS object to establish 'unicode' as the default value for backward compatibility.
# Details:
In the relevant TypeScript file (e.g., `src/main.ts` or a dedicated types file), update the `QuickEmojiSettings` interface to add `insertionFormat: 'unicode' | 'shortcode'`. Then, modify the `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` constant to include `insertionFormat: 'unicode'`. This ensures that existing users who upgrade will default to the original Unicode insertion behavior, preventing unexpected changes to their workflow.

# Test Strategy:
Perform a static type check using the TypeScript compiler (e.g., `tsc`) to ensure no type errors are introduced. Manually review the git diff to confirm the interface and default object are correctly updated as specified.
