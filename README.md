## How It Works: Shortcode Storage

Quick Emoji uses a **shortcode-first approach** that ensures your emoji data remains consistent and portable across different platforms and devices.

### What are Shortcodes?

Shortcodes are text representations of emojis in the format `:emoji_name:` (e.g., `:smile:`, `:rocket:`, `:heart:`). This is the same format used by platforms like GitHub, Discord, and Slack.

### Benefits of Shortcode Storage

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Your notes will display correctly on any device or operating system
- **Future-Proof**: Shortcodes remain readable even if emoji rendering changes
- **Version Control Friendly**: Git and other version control systems handle shortcodes cleanly
- **Search-Friendly**: You can search for `:smile:` to find all instances of that emoji
- **No Sync Issues**: Eliminates emoji rendering problems when syncing between devices

### Smart Display Modes

- **Source Mode**: Shows the actual shortcodes (`:wave:`, `:tada:`) for precise editing
- **Live Preview Mode**: Automatically renders shortcodes as emoji glyphs (üëã, üéâ) while you type
- **Reading Mode**: Displays beautiful emoji glyphs for the best reading experience

This approach gives you the benefits of both worlds: reliable, portable storage with beautiful visual rendering.

## Usage

1. Type `:` in any editor to activate the emoji suggester
2. Continue typing to search for specific emojis (e.g., `:smile`, `:rocket`)
3. Use arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select an emoji
4. The selected emoji will be inserted as a shortcode (e.g., `:smile:`)
5. In Live Preview and Reading modes, shortcodes automatically render as emoji glyphs
6. Click the star icon (‚≠ê) next to any emoji to add it to your favorites for quick access

### Viewing Your Emojis

- **Source Mode**: See the raw shortcodes (`:wave:`, `:heart:`) for editing
- **Live Preview**: See emoji glyphs (üëã, ‚ù§Ô∏è) while typing, shortcodes when actively editing
- **Reading Mode**: See beautiful emoji glyphs (üëã, ‚ù§Ô∏è) for the best reading experience

## Settings
