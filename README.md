## How It Works: Insertion Format Options

Quick Emoji gives you the flexibility to choose how emojis are inserted into your notes, allowing you to pick the approach that best fits your workflow.

### Insertion Format Options

#### Unicode Emoji (Default)

- **What it is**: Inserts native emoji characters directly (üôÇ, üöÄ, ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- **Best for**: Users who want emojis visible in all Obsidian views immediately
- **Pros**: Universal visibility, immediate visual feedback, works everywhere
- **Cons**: May not sync perfectly across all devices/platforms

#### Shortcode Format

- **What it is**: Inserts text codes (`:smile:`, `:rocket:`, `:heart:`) that render as emojis
- **Best for**: Users who want maximum compatibility and portability
- **Pros**: Perfect cross-platform sync, version control friendly, future-proof
- **Cons**: Only renders as emojis in Live Preview and Reading modes

### What are Shortcodes?

Shortcodes are text representations of emojis in the format `:emoji_name:` (e.g., `:smile:`, `:rocket:`, `:heart:`). This is the same format used by platforms like GitHub, Discord, and Slack.

### Benefits of Shortcode Format

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Your notes will display correctly on any device or operating system
- **Future-Proof**: Shortcodes remain readable even if emoji rendering changes
- **Version Control Friendly**: Git and other version control systems handle shortcodes cleanly
- **Search-Friendly**: You can search for `:smile:` to find all instances of that emoji
- **No Sync Issues**: Eliminates emoji rendering problems when syncing between devices

### Smart Display Modes (Shortcode Format Only)

When using shortcode format, Quick Emoji provides intelligent rendering across different Obsidian modes:

- **Source Mode**: Shows the actual shortcodes (`:wave:`, `:tada:`) for precise editing
- **Live Preview Mode**: Automatically renders shortcodes as emoji glyphs (üëã, üéâ) while you type
- **Reading Mode**: Displays beautiful emoji glyphs for the best reading experience

This gives you the benefits of both worlds: reliable, portable storage with beautiful visual rendering.

## Usage

1. Type `:` in any editor to activate the emoji suggester
2. Continue typing to search for specific emojis (e.g., `:smile`, `:rocket`)
3. Use arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select an emoji
4. The selected emoji will be inserted according to your chosen format:
   - **Unicode format**: Direct emoji character (üôÇ)
   - **Shortcode format**: Text code (`:smile:`) that renders as emoji in Live Preview/Reading modes
5. Click the star icon (‚≠ê) next to any emoji to add it to your favorites for quick access
6. Access recent and favorite emojis from the plugin settings for quick insertion

### Viewing Your Emojis

The viewing experience depends on your chosen insertion format:

**Unicode Format**: Emojis appear as native characters (üëã, ‚ù§Ô∏è) in all modes

**Shortcode Format**:

- **Source Mode**: See the raw shortcodes (`:wave:`, `:heart:`) for editing
- **Live Preview**: See emoji glyphs (üëã, ‚ù§Ô∏è) while typing, shortcodes when actively editing
- **Reading Mode**: See beautiful emoji glyphs (üëã, ‚ù§Ô∏è) for the best reading experience

## Settings

- **Insertion format**: Choose how emojis are inserted into your notes:
  - **Unicode emoji**: Insert as native characters (üôÇ) - visible in all views
  - **Shortcode**: Insert as text codes (`:smile:`) - rendered in Reading Mode
- **Default skin tone**: Choose from Default, Light, Medium-Light, Medium, Medium-Dark, or Dark
- **Recent emoji count**: Set the number of recent emojis to remember (5-50)
